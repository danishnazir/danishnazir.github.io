# About
I am a MSc. student in Informatik with specializations in Intelligent Systems and Visualizations and Scientific Computing at Technical University of Kaiserslautern. I am currently focussing on my Master's thesis titled as "LiDaR Depth Completion for Autonomous Driving" at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) under the supervision of Professor [Didier Stricker](https://av.dfki.de/members/stricker/) and [Zeeshan Afzal](https://av.dfki.de/members/afzal/). To continue my graduate studies, I am looking for Ph.D. positions in Deep Learning and Computer Vision with application areas in Multi-modal sensor fusion, Self-driving vehicles, and Autonomous Systems.
